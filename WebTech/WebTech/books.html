                <h2> Jane Austen </h2>
                <p> Pride and Prejudice is a very successful 1813 romantic novel of manners by English author Jane Austen. The first <br>
                    edition sold out within the first year and it never went out<span id="dots1">...</span> <span id="more1"> of print. It centres on the burgeoning relationship <br>
                    between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, (who was reportedly Austen’s own favourite among <br>
                    all her heroines) and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. Throughout the novel, Austen skillfully <br>
                    explores the themes of class, gender and social hierarchy in Georgian England. However, she also shows how <br>
                    individuals can challenge and subvert these norms, through their intelligence, wit and courage.</span>

                    psychological analysis of the poor former student Raskolnikov, whose<span id="dots5">...</span> <span id="more5"> theory that he is an extraordinary person able <br>
                    to take on the spiritual responsibility of using evil means to achieve humanitarian ends leads him to murder. <br>
                    But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is <br>
                    pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. <br>
                    Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption. The story is one of the finest studies of <br>
